1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS is one JS library that is specifically made for building user interfaces and allows developers to create web pages/applications and making the changes to the webpage/app based on your code without you having to reload the webpage (it basically serves as a virtual DOM). The reason this is useful and the problem it is trying to solve is the time/energy intensive nature of using the DOM for manipulating the state and also to minimize the number or errors made.

2. What does it mean to think in react?

To think in react basically means to break things down in terms of functionality - you try to work with one small component at a time.

3. Describe state.
State is an object where components store their data (HTML/CSS data) and each of the components have theur own state/prooperties; these components taken together are what make up a react application.

4. Describe props.

Props basically are arguments that are passed into components in React. They are similar to function arguments found in JS and attributes that are found in HTML.

5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

Side effects are parts of the code that impact/affect things that are outside of the scope and to sync the effects you need the DOM to update, because the observed changes are visible only once the calculation/update is completed.
